1.Declaration:

.Pointer to a structure: You can declare a pointer to a structure using the structure's name and 
the asterisk (*) symbol.

.Pointer to an array: You can declare a pointer to an array by specifying the type of elements 
in the array followed by an asterisk (*) symbol

2.Initialization:

.Pointer to a structure: To initialize a pointer to a structure, 
you typically assign the address of a structure variable to the pointer.

.Pointer to an array: You can initialize a pointer to an array by assigning the address of the 
first element of the array to the pointer.

3.Usage:

Pointer to a structure: With a pointer to a structure, you can access the members of the structure 
using the arrow (->) operator.

.Pointer to an array: With a pointer to an array, you can access the elements of the array 
using the dereference operator (*).

4.Memory Allocation:

Pointer to a structure: You can dynamically allocate memory for a structure 
using functions like malloc() or calloc().
.Pointer to an array: You can dynamically allocate memory for an array 
using functions like malloc() or calloc(). 

5.Arithmetic Operations:

.Pointer to a structure: Pointer arithmetic operations (e.g., increment, decrement) are not allowed 
on pointers to structures.

.Pointer to an array: Pointer arithmetic operations can be performed on pointers to arrays...
